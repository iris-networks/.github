## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**IRIS** is an autonomous agent platform that can see, click, type, and reason â€” just like a human â€” across browsers, desktops, terminals, and full computing environments.

Weâ€™re building from **Singapore** for a global audience. IRIS replaces fragile, script-based automation and bloated RPA stacks with a programmable, model-driven runtime that actually works in the real world.

---

### ðŸ§  What IRIS Does

* Controls full GUI environments (desktop + browser + terminal)
* Runs as a containerized agent with remote VNC/WebRTC access
* Executes user-level workflows (data entry, devops tasks, etc.) without APIs
* Uses LLMs + custom tools to reason, plan, and act autonomously
* Built for devs who want control, composability, and no vendor BS

You can think of it like:

```
Q: Can IRIS control Excel, the browser, and the terminal all at once?
A: Yes. And it doesnâ€™t need an API to do it.
```

### ðŸ§© IRIS Architecture

* **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** our open agent-runtime spec
* **Runtime Backends:** Playwright, VNC, and hybrid environments
* **Execution Layer:** CLI, HTTP, or prompt-driven agent commands
* **Infra-first Design:** containerized, composable, horizontally scalable

Itâ€™s fast. Itâ€™s built in Go + TS. And itâ€™s meant to be plugged into your actual stack â€” not some drag-and-drop abstraction.

### ðŸ”§ Projects to Explore

* [`mcp`](https://github.com/tryiris/mcp) â€“ model execution protocol
* [`mcp-terminal-server`](https://github.com/tryiris/mcp-terminal-server) â€“ terminal server that executes commands from LLM agents
* [`mcp-server-browser`](https://github.com/tryiris/mcp-server-browser) â€“ programmatic browser control over SSE/HTTP

Everything is modular. You can compose agents from protocols or just embed our infra in your product.

### ðŸ¥· Team Energy

* Anti-bloat. Anti-vendor-lock. Infra > interfaces.
* Weâ€™ll ship tools, not decks. Protocols, not promises.
* Building IRIS because automation should feel like code, not punishment.
