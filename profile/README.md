## Hi there 👋

**IRIS** is your AI-powered operator for real computers — one that can see, click, type, and reason across browsers, terminals, and full GUI desktops.

This is for devs everywhere who are tired of brittle scripts, outdated RPA platforms, and cloud tools that pretend to automate but just abstract.

IRIS gives you full control over environments, not just APIs. It runs workflows like a real user — and it doesn’t flake out when the UI changes.

### ⚙️ Why We're Building IRIS

We’re builders who’ve dealt with bad automation: half-working APIs, flaky no-code tools, and overpriced enterprise software with glossy decks and no edge reliability.

IRIS exists because:

* Automation should feel like writing real code.
* You should be able to program the whole computer — not just patch together APIs.
* We want to *actually* replace humans in rote workflows, not just simulate the idea of it.

This isn’t about "AI agents" for the hype. It’s about building reliable systems with real execution power.

### 🧠 What IRIS Does

* Controls entire user environments — browser, desktop, terminal
* Runs headlessly in containers with VNC/WebRTC access
* Executes real user-level workflows (data entry, cloud ops, onboarding)
* Doesn’t rely on brittle APIs or hand-rolled scripts
* Composable from the ground up: infra, not interfaces

IRIS doesn’t fake automation. It does the damn thing.

```
Q: Can IRIS install packages in a terminal, fill in Excel, and submit a form in the browser?
A: All at once, yes. With no integration required.

### 🧩 How It Works

* **MCP (Model Context Protocol):** runtime protocol between models and environments
* **Backends:** terminal, browser, and full desktop environments (Playwright, VNC, hybrid)
* **Execution Interface:** run via CLI, HTTP, or directly through a prompt
* **Infra-Native:** container-first, horizontally scalable, and DevOps-friendly

Built in Go + TypeScript. No magic. Just predictable, programmable automation you can embed or extend.

### 🧰 Projects in the Ecosystem

* [`k8s-orchestrator`](https://github.com/iris-networks/k8s-orchestrator) – Kubernetes orchestration for agent infrastructure
* [`terminal_mcp`](https://github.com/iris-networks/terminal_mcp) – terminal control with context via MCP
* [`loopgate`](https://github.com/iris-networks/loopgate) – gateway and routing for agent workflows

IRIS is modular. You can run your own agents, embed ours, or fork it to build something weird. That’s the point.

### 🥷 How We Think

* Infra > interfaces. Protocols > platforms.
* We ship code, not PowerPoints.
* Automation should feel like using Linux, not dragging blocks around.
