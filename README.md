# 🌐 IRIS: Autonomous Agents for Real-World Automation

> Built in Singapore. Automating the world.

IRIS is an open automation platform for building autonomous agents that can **control browsers, applications, and full computing environments** — no brittle scripts, no rigid RPA platforms.

We’re rethinking how machines interact with software. Think of IRIS as your **AI teammate**: it understands intent, takes action across apps, and learns as it goes.

## 🧠 What is IRIS?

IRIS is a fully programmable **Autonomous Agent Runtime** that can:

* 🔁 Control browsers, web apps, and desktop environments (via Playwright, VNC, custom protocols)
* 📊 Automate enterprise workflows without the traditional RPA pain
* 🧩 Integrate with your tools and APIs via plugins or code
* 🔒 Run securely in containers or on-prem environments
* ⚙️ Be controlled via CLI, API, or natural language prompts

We combine **LLMs, real-time environments, and resilient stateful execution** into a single cohesive platform.

## 🏗️ Architecture

IRIS is built on:

* ✨ [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/tryiris/mcp) – A protocol for controlling agents via model prompts
* 🧠 LLM Orchestration – Claude / GPT / Custom models
* 🖥️ Remote GUI Rendering – VNC, WebRTC, and browser-level control
* 🧩 Plugin System – Easily inject custom tools and API logic

---

## 🌍 About Us

IRIS is built by a team of engineers and researchers in **Singapore**, building the future of automation. We believe agents should be:

* 🧠 **Smarter** than brittle scripts
* 🛠️ **Programmable** like code
* 🌐 **Controllable** by anyone
